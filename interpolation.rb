# Using string interpolation to insert the result of an expression
result = "The sum of #{a} and #{b} is #{a + b}."
puts result

# Explanation
# #{a + b}: This inserts the result of the expression a + b into the string.
# Why Use Interpolation?
# Readability: Interpolation makes your code more readable and concise.
#   Convenience: It allows you to easily construct strings with dynamic content.
#   Flexibility: You can include variables and expressions directly within strings.
